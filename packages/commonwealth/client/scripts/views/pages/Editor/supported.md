# Quotes

> Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a
> new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men
> are created equal. 

> Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any 
> nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great 
> battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, 
> as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation 
> might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
