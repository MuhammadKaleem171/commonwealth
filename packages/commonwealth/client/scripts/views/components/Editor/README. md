# Overview

Markdown Editor based on MDXEditor customized for our usage.

It supports desktop and mobile mode.

In desktop mode the UI is responsive and uses a static layout so it can
operate within the flow of a regular document.

In mobile mode it docks the toolbar above the keyboard.

# Fork

This is currently using the commonwealth-mdxeditor, which is a fork of the
mdx-editor package.

This is just temporary as I plan on merging this into the main MDXEditor when
we are done.

Right now the only change is a 'location' property added to the toolbar code
so that we can place the toolbar below the editor.

# Testing

## Desktop

- success: copy a .md file to the clipboard, try to paste it into the editor. It
  should insert the content at the editor's cursor

- success: drag a .md file on top of the editor.  The drag indicator should show
  up and cover the editor while you're dragging.

- success: use the 'Import markdown' button to upload a file.

- failure: copy multiple .md files ot the clipboard, try to paste into the editor.
  It should fail because we can't handle multiple .md files

- success: right click on an image in the browser, try to paste it into the editor.

- success: take a screenshot, try to paste it into the editor. The upload
  indicator should show up.

- success: use the image button at the top to manually upload an image. The
  upload indicator should show up while this is happening.

## Mobile

- The toolbar should be present at the bottom of the UI.
